## DHT Performance

We are running lean libp2p peers that just support the Kademlia DHT protocol in six different AWS regions. Each peer takes turns to publish the provider record for a CID of random data. All other peers are then instructed to lookup that CID. "Looking up" here means finding the provider record. So the numbers below don't show the actual content retrieval times (which would depend on file sizes) but instead the DHT performance. The peers run `go-libp2p-kad-dht` version `v0.21.1` + default configurations.

Code can be found here: [probe-lab/parsec](https://github.com/probe-lab/parsec) (we plan to move this to our [ProbeLab organization](https://github.com/probe-lab))

**TODO**: As soon as we have more than two full weeks of data we'll report weekly graphs.

### Weekly

![Weekly Region CDF Publications + Retrievals](./plots/parsec-regions-cdf.png)

The number in parenthesis is the number of publications/retrievals for that particular region that went into the calculation.

![Weekly Region Boxplot Publications + Retrievals](./plots/parsec-regions-boxplot.png)

The number in the box is the number of publications/retrievals for that particular region that went into the calculation.

The box extends from the first quartile (Q1) to the third quartile (Q3) of the data, with a line at the median. The whiskers extend from the box by 1.5x the inter-quartile range (IQR). Flier points are those past the end of the whiskers. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot for reference.

### Daily

![Daily Publications Boxplot](./plots/parsec-publications-boxplot-daily.png)

The number in the box is the number of publications that went into the calculation of the box.

The box extends from the first quartile (Q1) to the third quartile (Q3) of the data, with a line at the median. The whiskers extend from the box by 1.5x the inter-quartile range (IQR). Flier points are those past the end of the whiskers. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot for reference.
